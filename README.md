# Enigma Machine Simulation

This project is a Python implementation of the Enigma machine, a cipher device used by Germany during World War II. The Enigma machine enabled secure communication by encoding messages with a complex substitution cipher that varied with each keystroke.

## Features:
- **Plugboard (Steckerbrett) Connections**: Allows for up to 10 pairs of letters to be swapped for additional encryption complexity.
- **Rotors and Notches**: Simulates the mechanical rotors of the Enigma machine, including the notch positions that cause the next rotor to advance.
- **Reflector**: Includes three historical reflector types (A, B, C) that reverse the electrical signal for the return trip through the rotors.
- **Rotor Rotation and Double Stepping**: Implements accurate rotor stepping mechanism including the double-stepping anomaly.
- **Encoding and Decoding**: Encodes and decodes messages using the configured Enigma settings.

## Usage:
- **Setup Connections**: Configure plugboard connections for letter swapping.
- **Select Rotors and Reflector**: Choose rotors and reflector types for the encryption.
- **Set Rotor Positions**: Initialize rotor positions to a specific setting before encoding messages.
- **Encode Messages**: Input plaintext messages to receive the encoded ciphertext.

This project serves as an educational tool to understand the inner workings of the Enigma machine and the principles of classical cryptography. It demonstrates the complexity of mechanical encryption devices and the historical significance of the Enigma machine in cryptographic history." > README.md
